            </br>Ringing from the cries of our heroes
                
        </br>Heroes whose only crime was demanding for a better life
                
    </br>Life that ought to be sweet but has been sour for too long
                
</br>Long enough to threaten our very existence
                
</br>Existence that should be of essence in a sane world
                
</br>World that ought to strive to be better and peaceful
                
</br>Peaceful and generous to those with strong spirit
                
</br>Spirit that pushes far beyond expectation but now sleeping in the spirit world
                
</br>World of the permanently silent, silenced by several means
                
</br>Means by which history is set,
                
</br>Set on 20-10-2020 night
                
</br>Night to remember not to forget that unjust murders were committed
                
</br>And their silence is so loud our ears remain ringing.</p>
